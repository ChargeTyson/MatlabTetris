# MatlabTetris

This is code from freshman year so it's really rough around the edges. But this is still one of the most fun projects I've worked on in college. We were only supposed to make a simple game like a text based adventure, blackjack, connect four, etc. but I looked at the tools provided and gave myself a challenge to make a game I would be proud of. So I tried recreating Tetris and actually completed the whole project in only a day, when we were given three full weeks to complete the assignment.
